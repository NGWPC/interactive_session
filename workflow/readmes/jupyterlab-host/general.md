## JupyterLab Interactive Session
This workflow starts a JupyterLab server [interactive session](https://github.com/parallelworks/interactive_session/blob/main/README.md).


### Requirements
This workflow is only compatible with cloud clusters or clusters where the user has root access. To use this workflow on different resources, we must first create an nginx singularity container within those resources.
