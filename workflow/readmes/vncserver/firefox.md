## RStudio Interactive Session
This workflow launches Firefox in a remote desktop [interactive session](https://github.com/parallelworks/interactive_session/blob/main/README-v3.md) accessible via a web browser on a **Compute Cluster** (SLURM or PBS).

It utilizes either TurboVNC, TigerVNC or KasmVNC, depending on which is installed on the target resource.
