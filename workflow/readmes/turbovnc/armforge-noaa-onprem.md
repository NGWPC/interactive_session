## Arm Forge Interactive Session
This workflow starts a remote desktop [interactive session](https://github.com/parallelworks/interactive_session/blob/main/README.md) and starts Arm Forge.

**Arm Forge must be installed, and the appropriate command (e.g., `module load armforge`) must be entered in the workflow's input form.**
