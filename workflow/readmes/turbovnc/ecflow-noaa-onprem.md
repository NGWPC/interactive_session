## ecFlow Interactive Session
This workflow starts a remote desktop [interactive session](https://github.com/parallelworks/interactive_session/blob/main/README-v3.md) and starts ecFlow.

**ecFlow must be installed, and the appropriate command (e.g., `module load ecflow`) must be entered in the workflow's input form.**
